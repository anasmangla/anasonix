# Anasonix Website

Anasonix is a website project built using modern web technologies. This repository currently contains only the project logo, but the goal is to develop a full Tailwind CSS based website using Font Awesome icons and other tools.

## Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd anasonix
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**
   The project will use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). Install Node.js dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start a local dev server with hot reloading.

## Build & Deployment

1. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   The compiled files will be generated in the `dist/` directory.
2. **Deploy**
   Upload the contents of `dist/` to your preferred hosting provider (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, or a traditional web server).

## Technologies Used

- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling.
- **Font Awesome** for icons.
- **JavaScript** tooling via npm scripts.
- Optionally integrate additional tools like Webpack or Vite as the project grows.
