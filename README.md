# Anasonix

Anasonix is a website project built using modern web technologies. This repository currently contains images for Anasonix, including the project logo. The goal is to develop a full website using Tailwind CSS, Font Awesome icons, and other modern tools.

## Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd anasonix
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**
   Install Node.js packages and other assets:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This starts a local server with hot reloading so you can develop quickly.

## Building the Project

1. **Compile for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   The optimized files will be placed in the `dist/` directory.

## Running Tests

The project includes a simple test suite. You can run it with npm or via the provided Makefile:

```bash
npm test       # run tests directly
make test      # equivalent wrapper defined in the Makefile
```

## Deployment

Upload the contents of `dist/` to your preferred hosting provider (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, or a traditional web server).

## Running Tests

Use the provided `Makefile` to run any project tests.

```bash
make test
```

This command simply invokes `npm test`.

## Technologies Used

- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling.
- **Font Awesome** for icons.
- **JavaScript** tooling via npm scripts.
- Optionally integrate additional tools like Webpack or Vite as the project grows.
